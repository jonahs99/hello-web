# Which platform?

So you have an idea and want to build something to share with the world! Before you get started, you have to chose a platform build for. Really you want to build for everyone, but you have to start somewhere. Will you chose:

- Mobile (iOS or Android? or Windows Phone?)
- Desktop (Mac or Windows? what about Linux?)

In general, each platform has different capabilities so you need different tools to make things for them. If you want to reach multiple platforms you basically have to rewrite your app.

But every platform has a web browser! And every web browser is (almost) the same! Look what we get if we make a web app:

- Almost any platform can run it
- Sharing is a breeze
- No app store! No updates!
