So far, we've seen how HTML and CSS can be used to describe the content and look of a document.

You can do a surprising amount with just HTML and CSS, but when we want to specify a specific set of instruction for our app to do, it is nicer to use JavaScript. Where HTML and CSS are both *declaritive* (how should the page look?), JavaScript is *imperative* (what should the page do?).

In this section, we will write some JavaScript to run a sequence of operations, so that we choose a random image, load the image, and show it to the user.

Here's a quick overview of some syntax we will use. You should try typing these commands in the console (that tab in the dev tools).

```javascript
{{#include ../../3-make-it-do-something/syntax.js}}
```
