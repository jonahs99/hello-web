# Make it do something

Now we will do some programming. Update `index.html` to load a script file.

Filename: `3-make-it-do-something/index.html`
```html
{{#include ../../3-make-it-do-something/index.html}}
```

Make a file for the script.

Filename: `3-make-it-do-something/script.js`
```js
{{#include ../../3-make-it-do-something/script.js}}
```

Here we use the NASA API to load a random astronomy image each time someone visits our page.
