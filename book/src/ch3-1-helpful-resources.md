# General resources

One tricky thing about web technologies is that they change really fast. If you see any JavaScript tutorials with `var` in the code, it's probably a few years old and I would suggest finding something else.

[MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/): For general Javascript/HTML/CSS questions. Half of my google searches are something like `mdn array splice`. Documentation is close to the spec and great for checking support on different browser versions.

[Flex box](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/): Vertical centering and other stretchy CSS magic.

# Native web APIs

These are APIs that your browsers gives you direct access to.

[Canvas](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API/Tutorial): The `<canvas>` element let's you draw graphics. You can make cool effects, art, games, anything!

[Audio](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Audio_API): I haven't played with this much but it looks really cool. You can combine audio effects or generate sounds on the fly.

[A whole lot more](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API): I really can't list everything!

# Libraries

This is code you can include in your app. This usually involves a compilation step where some tool combines your code from multiple sources, but soon people should start moving towards using [JavaScript modules](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Modules).

[React](https://reactjs.org/): For declaritive UI programming.
