# Plan

Hi! This little book will walk us through making a simple web app.

If all goes well, we will:

- Learn the basic structure of a web application
- Use the dev tools to poke at running web apps
- Write our own web page
- Add code to our web page to make it do something

Please feel free to deviate if you are curious about something!

At then end, we will work on extending our space themed app. So if you find yourself with extra time, take a look at the NASA open APIs.
