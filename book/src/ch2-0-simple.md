# A simple page

A static website is a set of pages that a user can access and open in their browser.

Open up your dev tools `Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + I`, and take a look at what the page you're reading is made of.

It's pretty complicated! I didn't write code for this page. It was generated with a [tool](https://rust-lang-nursery.github.io/mdBook/index.html) for making pretty online books. These days, most pages will not be written by hand. They are either generated through tools like this, or else generated on the fly by frameworks like React. For simple apps though, we can still get away with doing it by hand, and we will learn about what the browser is actually interpretting.

To get started we will:
- Make a basic HTML document
- Apply styles to the document with CSS
- Make the page do something with JavaScript
