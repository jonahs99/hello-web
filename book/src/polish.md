We made a working app!

What else can we do? Pick something that's interesting to you and try to make it happen:

- We should probably give credit to NASA. Add a link at the bottom of the page to the NASA Open API page: [https://api.nasa.gov/](https://api.nasa.gov/).
- Play with the styles a bit.
- The image info from NASA API has a separate URL for an HD image. Modify the script to load the HD image.
- Modify the script to include the explanation paragraph.
