# Making on the web

Hi!

When people think "web dev" I imagine they think of UI programming. My take is more that I want to make cool things that people can easily access.

Your web browser is probably one of the biggest programs on your computer. It can really do a lot!

What was originally about viewing documents (I'm not actually old enough to remember this) is now basically an operating system that can quickly spin up any kind of app. An app can be a blog, but it can also be a showcase for generative art or a multiplayer game or a complex drawing program.

These days, I usually default to making on the web if I just want to try something out. Usually, it's possible to throw something together pretty quickly, and it's perfect if I want to share it. Who's going to go to my GitHub and figure out how to run my project? On the web, I just tell them a link.

Okay I hope you are convinced, let's take a look at the plan for today.
