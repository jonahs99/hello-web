# A simple page

A static website is a set of pages that a user can access and open in their browser.

This book is a static website. Open up your dev tools `Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + I`, and take a look at what it's made of.

It's pretty complicated! I didn't write code for this page. It was generated with a [tool](https://rust-lang-nursery.github.io/mdBook/index.html) for making pretty online books. These days, most pages will not be written by hand. They are either generated through tools like this, or else generated on the fly by frameworks like React. For simple apps though, we can still get away with doing it by hand, and we will learn about what the browser is actually interpretting.

On the next page, we will play around with the browser tools to modify the page!
