# Make it pretty

Remember changing the colors with the dev tools? The styles are describes with CSS. Instead of applying styles to individual elements, we can group style rules together into a stylesheet to apply to the whole document.

Update `index.html` to include a stylesheet.

Filename: `2-make-it-pretty/index.html`
```html
{{#include ../../2-make-it-pretty/index.html}}
```

And add the styles in a new file `style.css`.

Filename: `2-make-it-pretty/style.css`
```css
{{#include ../../2-make-it-pretty/style.css}}
```

Try adding or changing the styles. What changes if you change `body`?

What a cliff hanger!
