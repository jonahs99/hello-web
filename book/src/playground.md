# Playground

Try poking around this page with the dev tools. You can always get back to the original by refreshing `Ctrl\Cmd + R`.

<div id="playground">

<p>What kind of element is this?</p>

<p>Maybe you can fix the splleing?</p>

<p>I would prefer if this square was pink</p>

<div id="square" style="color: white; background: blue; width: 120px; height: 120px;">
	My id is 'square'
</div>

<p>Try changing the color with the console</p>

<p>Or changing it when you click the button</p>

<button id="button">My id is 'button'</button>

</div>

Now that we have a sense of what's in a web page, we can make our own. In the next sections we will:
- Make a basic HTML document
- Apply styles to the document with CSS
- Make the page do something with JavaScript
